# Task Scheduler
## I left this project public only to show my progress in programming which I made in 11 months. If you look at my recent projects you'll know what I'm talking about :) This code is not clean and not optimized, I know. But I keep this speed of self-developing, so I only wonder what will appear on this profile in the next year :D 



## Description
It's your own task organizer. If you are a busy person and you want to make better use of your time, this is a desktop app for you. With Task Scheduler you can add a new assignment with description and deadline, set its priority and then save it to database. At any moment you have access to your tasks, you can manage them and better plan your day. When you turn on your computer in the morning, all you have to do is to check your email box and read today's to-do list which was sent by script. Easy and convenient.

### How automatically generated email looks like?

It's a desktop version of email, but it's responsive and on mobile phone looks even better.
